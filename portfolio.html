          Hello my name is <STRONG>SIZWE NKALA from south africa</STRONG> i am a self taught web
           developer since August 2020. I fell in love with developing ever since
           i had my first cellphone,i've always wondered how do they make such applications
           work on various devices and that's when i discoverd programming/coding.
           <strong>my goal in life is to add meaningfull contributions to the society
           we live in.</strong>I get excited when i learn new concepts in life and
           in programming/coding.
         </p>
         <p id="secondP" >
           i've learned skills like <strong>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT,
           REACT.JS, NODE.JS AND MONGODB</strong>, But i prefer to build the front end
           side of projects because of all creativity involved in making an applications
           have all kinds of functionalities and also making the applications i'm
           building look pretty it's rewarding for me.

          <img src="./images/screenshot (29).png" alt="">
          <p>my first project as a web developer was to develop a <strong>BOOK & GADGET STORE</strong>.
             I was asked by a friend of mine to develop this site, it was scary at first
             since i've had never done something like that.The site is not fully responsive
             but i'm proud to include it in portfolio  because it shows the beginning
             of my incredible journey into web development.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>THE OBJECTIVE</strong> of this site is to sell books and phones to the target market
            the friend identified. I used  <strong>HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT AND NODE.JS</strong> TO complete
            the project.
